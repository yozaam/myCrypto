A block stores: ( block.js file )\
  timestamp\
  lastHash\
  data\
  hash\
  \
This will be designed with Test Driven Development - for confidence, reliability, speed and to learn TDD :P :) \
\
tasks completed:\
	built genesis block\
	added mining functionality\
	developed sha256 hash functionality\
\
next task:\
	~~link blocks, create blockchain ! :D~~\
	~~validate blockchain:\
		correct block fields,\
		lastHash reference previous block only! ( links ),\
		valid hash~~\
<br>
		~~chain replacement:\
		all nodes need to agree on single chain~~\
\
		~~stub console outputs~~\
		\
		~~proof of work system:\
			computation to mine\
			static difficulty~~\
